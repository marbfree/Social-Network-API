## Installation 
  Clone the repository, then npm install in the terminal.  Once packages are installed, npm start will start the server.  Using Insomnia, you can run though all the API's.
## Usage 
  When API GET routes are opened in Insomnia for users and thoughts, then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON. When API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes are opened, then I am able to create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database.  When I test API POST and DELETE routes, then I am able to successfylly create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and delete friends to a user.
